# Dataquest Guided Projects  

This repository contains my solutions to various **Guided Projects** from [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/). These projects cover a range of data science and analytics topics, including **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, SQL, machine learning, and web scraping**.  

Each project follows a structured approach, applying real-world datasets to reinforce key skills in Python, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and other essential tools.  

## Projects Included  
- **Hacker News Post Analysis** – Exploring engagement patterns in 'Ask HN' and 'Show HN' posts.  
- **Used Car Listings Analysis** – Cleaning and analyzing eBay Kleinanzeigen car listings to find market trends.  
- **I-94 Traffic Analysis** – Investigating traffic indicators on the I-94 interstate highway.  
- **NYC High School SAT Scores** – Analyzing factors influencing SAT performance in NYC public schools.  
- **Employee Resignation Analysis** – Examining resignation trends in a company to identify potential issues.   
- *(More projects will be added as I progress!)*  

## Repository Structure  
- Each project is organized in its own folder, containing Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) and relevant datasets (if applicable).
